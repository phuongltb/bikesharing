Create visualizations for bike sharing in NYC using Panda and Tableau

## Overview of the project
This project is to create a story of bike sharing in NYC focusing to answer the following questions:
  - Find the Peak Riding Hours in August
  - Who tends to use bike sharing the most
  - The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  - The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  - The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. 
 
## Results
1. The bar chart below shows the peak hours of bike sharing in August. The chart shows that 8AM-9AM and 5PM-6PM are the peak hours of bike sharing everyday

2. The pie chart below shows a Gender Breakdown of Active Riders. This chart states that Male riders tends to use bike sharing the most.

3. The chart below shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. The chart states that bikes were usually checked out for 5 minutes

4. The chart below shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender. The graph suggests that female riders checked out bikes for longer than male riders

5. The chart below shows the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. The heatmap suggests that most riders bike on Thursday at 8AM and 5PM-6PM.

6. The chart below shows the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap. The heatmap shows that the number of male riders are 3 times than female riders at peak hours.

7. The chart below shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype. Male and female subscribers are more active riders than male and female short-term customers while unknown short-term customers are more active riders than unknown annual subscribers.

These visualizations are included in a story which is published on Tableau Public and can be found in the link below:

## Summary
The visualization suggests that summer is not the good time for bike maintenance. But if a bike must be repaired during summer, then 10-1pm on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday would be the great time to repair it. The visualizations also suggest the number of bike needed at different time of everyday to supply for bike sharing activities. For example, 2 parts of weekdays, which are 8AM and 5PM-6PM, would need the most bikes.
 
Further analyses should be done to support the business of bike sharing. For example:
  - What are the highest-traffic locations
  - What is the breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers
